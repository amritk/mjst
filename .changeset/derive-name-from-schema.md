Derive the root type name from the schema's `title` instead of always using "Document". The CLI now generates types and parsers named after the schema (e.g. an "OpenAPI Document" title yields `OpenAPIDocument` / `parseOpenAPIDocument`), falling back to `Document` when the schema has no usable title. Adds a `deriveRootTypeName` helper to `@amritk/helpers`.
