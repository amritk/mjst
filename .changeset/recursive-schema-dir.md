Add `--schemaDir` for recursive generation: point mjst at a directory of JSON Schemas and it generates parsers for every `*.json` file, mirroring the directory layout under `outDir`. The runtime helpers are emitted once into a shared `outDir/_helpers/` that every nested parser imports from (via a computed relative path), and `--build` compiles the whole tree in place. `buildSchema` gains an optional `helpersImportPrefix` argument to support the shared-helpers layout.
