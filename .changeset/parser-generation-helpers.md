Generated parser output is now self-contained when `@amritk/helpers` isn't installed in the consumer project.

- `@amritk/mjst` (CLI) auto-detects whether `@amritk/helpers` resolves from the consumer's `outDir`. When it doesn't, the CLI runs in **embedded** mode: the runtime helper sources are shipped alongside the generated parsers in `outDir/_helpers/` and imports are rewritten to `./_helpers/...`. When it does, the CLI runs in **package** mode (the historical behaviour) and continues to import from `@amritk/helpers/...`.
- New `--helpers <package|embedded>` CLI flag (and config key) lets callers override auto-detection — useful for forcing self-contained output in CI or when shipping generated code to a runtime without `@amritk/helpers` installed.
- `@amritk/generate-parsers`' `buildSchema()` takes a new optional `helpersMode` parameter; in embedded mode it appends `_helpers/<name>.ts` entries to its returned `GeneratedFile[]` for each runtime helper the generated parsers actually use.
- The CLI's `--build` flag no longer relies on a brittle `compilerOptions.paths` mapping that pointed back into the CLI's own install location; in both modes, `tsc` now resolves helper imports via standard module resolution.
- `@amritk/helpers` extracts `hasRef` into its own subpath export (`@amritk/helpers/has-ref`). The existing `@amritk/helpers/schema-guards` continues to re-export it for backward compatibility.
